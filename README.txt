This Repository contains tools for fitting Black Hole Quasi-Normal Mode
signals to gravitational wave data (observered or created numerically).  The
executabel `FitAll.py` can be used, given strain data of the form found
in the SXS catalog, to predict the mass and spin of the remnant black hole
that produced the waves.  The qnms that are used for fitting are gathered
from Leo Stein's `qnm` package for python.
